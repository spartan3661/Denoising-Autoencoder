# Denoising Autoencoder for Image Noise Reduction

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project that implements a denoising autoencoder to remove noise from images. 
The model can only handle Gaussian noise and barely works.

## Project Goals
- Version 1 Goal: develop an autoencoder architecture to denoise gaussian noise using autoencoders with cnn layers.

## Usage

## Future Plans
- Future iterations will focus on optimizing the model and improving the quality of the denoised images.

## Installation and Usage
  1. Clone the repository
  2. ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/spartan3661/Denoising-Autoencoder.git
  3. Install requirements
     ```sh
     pip install -r requirements.txt
  4. Install pytorch with cuda
  5. Run download_data.py
  6. Run DenoiseAutoencoder.ipynb
  7. Run use_model.ipynb


The data used are the high resolution DIV2K training and validation sets.
